# resizecbz
Python script to resize all images inside a CBZ (Comic Book Zip)

You can control the maximum size of the image, the destination directory, and the extesion of the resized file via a configuration file.  A sample configuration file will be created the first time you run the script without any parameters.  By default the maximum width in landscape mode is 1366, the maximum height in portrait mode is 1080, the directory is a subdirectory "resized" underneath the source directory, and the default extension is "resized.cbz".
